shell-pipe-debugging
====================

Why?
----
A coworker was having trouble executing a streaming data processor in response
to specific log messages. I figured a condensed test case would make debugging
easier.

Instructions
------------
Run `./runme.sh` and you should see an "important output" line every five
seconds. If not something is wrong.
